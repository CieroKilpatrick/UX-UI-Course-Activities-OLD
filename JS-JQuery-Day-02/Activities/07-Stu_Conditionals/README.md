### Student Do: Conditionals (20 min)

**Files:**

- [unsolved.html](Unsolved/unsolved.html)

- [unsolved.js](Unsolved/unsolved.js)

**Instructions:**

- In this activity you are going to build a conditional to switch between two CSS stylesheets.

- Add code in [unsolved.js](Unsolved/unsolved.js) so that it uses an `if / else` conditional statement.

  - The commented-out code works, but is not a conditional since there are no `if / else` statements.

  - The commented-out code is listening for clicks on `#slate` and `#solar`.

  - Your new code should work similarly to the commented-out code. Namely, you should add conditionals such that when a theme button is clicked its respective theme is applied to the page. For example, "if this button is clicked, this stylesheet is selected."

**BONUS**

1. Add two more buttons to [unsolved.html](Unsolved/unsolved.html), giving your webpage the ability to switch between 4 themes in total.

  - Update your logic in [unsolved.js](Unsolved/unsolved.js) to handle this additional functionality.

2. Add additional Bootstrap components to the HTML to see how they change styles when the theme changes.

3. If you want an extra challenge, start with [unsolved-challenge.js](Unsolved/unsolved-challenge.js) or [unsolved-super-challenge.js](Unsolved/unsolved-super-challenge.js). If you use these be sure to update the JS link in the HTML, though we recommend starting with the regular unsolved!
