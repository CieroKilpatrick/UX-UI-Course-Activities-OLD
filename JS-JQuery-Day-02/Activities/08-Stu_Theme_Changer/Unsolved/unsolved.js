// Step 1: set up a click event listener for the theme-button class.

// Step 2: create a variable named "theme" to store the name of the theme that was just clicked.

// Step 3: create another variable called "$styleLink" to store the link with the id 'theme-stylesheet'

// Step 4: using if/else conditionals, update the stylesheet according to the button that was clicked (the button/theme name). For example, if the 'darkly' theme button was clicked, update the link element's href attribute to point at the .css file for the darkly theme.
