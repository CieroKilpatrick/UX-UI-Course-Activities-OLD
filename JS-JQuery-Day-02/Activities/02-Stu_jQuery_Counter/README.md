### Student Do: jQuery Counter (25 mins)

**Files:**

- [Unsolved/unsolved.css](Unsolved/unsolved.html)
- [Unsolved/unsolved.html](Unsolved/unsolved.js)

**Instructions:**

- Open [Unsolved/unsolved.html](Unsolved/unsolved.html) in your browser.

  - Currently you have a counter with the ability to increment.

- Open [Unsolved/unsolved.js](Unsolved/unsolved.js) in VS Code.

- Using the starter code, create the decrement and reset functionality.

**Bonus:**

- Add a "Double Increment" ( >> ) button to the right of the `+1` button that increases the count by two when clicked, and a "Double Decrement" ( << ) button to the left of the `-1` button that decreases the count by two when clicked.

  - Hint: for the `<` and `>` characters, you should use `&lt;` and `&gt` respectively in your HTML.
