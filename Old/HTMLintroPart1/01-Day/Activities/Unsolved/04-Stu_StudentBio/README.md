# HTML Bio

The best way to get used to rapid prototyping is to practice!  Let's build a HTML page with bio content.

## Instructions

- Create a basic HTML page that gives information about yourself.

- "Content is king" - think about what information people would want to see on a bio page about you, and include that information.

- Use the appropriate HTML elements as you build your page. You should include following elements.  Add more if you wish.

  - images
  - links
  - paragraphs
  - headers
  - lists

- Include interesting facts about yourself.  For example, add a list of favorite movies, links to your favorite sites, or a paragraph about your work experience.

**Bonus:**

- Create a contact form with labels and fields for an email address and a message.
